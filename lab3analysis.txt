1. What happens to memory when fork() creates a new process? Does the child get a complete copy of the parent's memory?
-  When the fork() creates a new process, the child gets a copy of the parent's memory, so the child start with the same
   variables and data as the parent.The child does get a complete copy of the parent's memory.
 
2. Why must unused pipe ends be closed? What would happen if you forgot to close them?
-  Unused pipe ends must be closed so the program knows that commands are finished. if you forget to close them, the
   process will just be left hanging as it will wait for more data.

3. What are zombie processes and how does wait() prevent them? What would happen to your system if zombie processes
   accumulated?
-  Zombie processes are processes that finished but the parent has not recieved the exit status and wait() prevents 
   zombie processes by collecting the exit status. If zombie processes acculmulate, they will continue to take up 
   system resources and eventually lead to no new process taking place.

4. How does the kernel track parent-child relationships? What happens if a parent process dies before its children?
-  The kernel tracks parent-child relationships using PID. If a parent process dies before its children, the 
   children become orphan processes and are assigned new parents.
